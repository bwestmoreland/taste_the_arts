              Let's face it; no one really starts their New Year's resolutions in January. It's not until February, when swimsuits start showing up at the mall, that we get serious about getting in shape. We can help with that, with a free month-long membership to any <a href="http://www.ymcagreenville.org">YMCA</a> location in Greenville or one month's worth of classes at <a href="http://www.crossfitalliance.com">Crossfit Alliance</a>. Going for luscious instead of lean this year? We've got that covered, too, with a Chocolate Bouquet, a basket from <a href="http://www.palmettooliveoilco.com/" target="_blank">Palmetto Olive Oil</a> and more. Come see what else is in store on February 1.

              We promised you more student artwork, and today we're featuring the work of Glenda Guion's Ceramics students. The class has donated several items, including hand-painted bowls, glazed vases and an entire spectrum of fiery framed tiles. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I said framed. Where else are you gonna find fabulously framed art for next to nothing? That's right -- nowhere.

              Fine Arts Center alumna Rebecca Payne has many talents. She's a musician by trade, but her creativity is visible in the unusual jewelry she creates -- from spare car parts. Inspired to make something beautiful out of the shiny washers she found in her father's garage, Becca's pieces are more than just funky jewelry with flair. They are works of art. The two necklace and earring sets shown here will be on offer at A Taste of the Fine Arts, and this is the only place you can get them.

              The single question I've been most frequently asked about this event has been, "Will there be student work available for auction or purchase?" The answer is yes. FAC students are most invested in the success of this event, because the funds we raise will directly benefit them. They have generously donated several items for fundraising purposes. Over the next week, we'll be showing off a few examples of the work you can expect to see at this year's A Taste of the Fine Arts, beginning with that of Donna Shank's 2D/3D Design class. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Last year, Ms. Shank's students contributed several handmade, journal-sized books to sell at the event. Yes, sell. These lovingly crafted and unique books were only $10! Needless to say, they were all sold in a matter of minutes after we opened the doors. They were such a big hit that we really hoped for more this year. Sometimes you get what you wish for, and this year's 2D/3D Design students have been working enthusiastically to produce another crop -- with the same low price tag. Make sure you get there early, or they will be gone!

              Those of you who have been to A Taste of the Fine Arts in the past and those of you who plan to attend for the first time may be wondering what to expect this year. We've changed venues! We've changed formats! We've changed websites! Whatever shall become of us? 
            </p>
            <p>
              Rest assured, the focus of the night will remain what it has always been and the reason we have the event at all: Fine Arts Center and the art being produced there. Even though we are not hosting this year's event at the school, we are still committed to highlighting student work and accomplishments. One of the reasons we are so excited to be in the Hyatt's gorgeous new venue, Studio 220, is that the space will allow us to display student compositions in a superb environment. Studio 220's art-gallery atmosphere is the perfect place to view student work from many of the school's departments, including visual arts and creative writing. We plan to screen performing arts pieces on video monitors, and the entire evening's festivities will be accompanied by the sounds of some of the school's most talented musicians. This format will allow guests to mingle freely throughout the space, linger wherever they like, and peruse the silent auction items thoroughly, without adhering to a set schedule. Enjoy the arts at your leisure; after all, it is the weekend!

              If you loved The Italian Job (Caine or Wahlberg, take your pick) and always thought those MINIs looked like a great way to pull of a grand heist, look no further. Century MINI of Greenville has donated a "MINI for a Weekend" (just long enough to execute your master plan) to be auctioned off at A Taste of the Fine Arts on February 1. MINIs are fuel efficient, zippy and more fun to drive than should be legal. They're easy to park almost anywhere. They come in sassy colors. They have legions of fans all over the world. (Plus they handle really well in the subway.)  Spend the weekend motoring around in a super cool MINI Cooper. You'll be able to pick the model that suits your fancy on a Friday and keep it until noon on Monday.

            There are myriad FAC student success stories. Roy Fluhrer, Director of the Fine Arts Center for the last 24 years, can rattle them off the way many men recall sports stats. He's not alone. FAC faculty who have been with the school for two years or 20 also have many stories to tell. The stories include high-profile individuals, such as Broadway performers Kimilee Bryant and Phillip Boykin and former Miss South Carolina Kelly McCorkle. Those are mentioned often because they garner a lot of attention. There are many more stories of spectacularly successful professional artists. Dancer Kevin Boseman, for example, toured for four and a half years in the National Tour of The Lion King  and in 2008 made his Broadway debut in Equus starring Daniel Radcliffe and Richard Griffiths -- after dancing with the Martha Graham Dance Company and being a principal with the world-renowned Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. There are more stories of working artists emerging from the FAC than can be told here. In addition, there are many other FAC alumni who have gone on to successful careers in law, medicine, civil service and other fields who credit their time at FAC with helping form their personalities and goals.

            If this refrain sounds familiar, it is because you've probably heard it before. Last year, TOWN magazine published an <a href="http://www.towncarolina.com/features/30-artists/430-sliding-doors.html">article</a> highlighting how FAC changes lives. It is the same message you get from almost anyone involved with the FAC. It is nearly impossible to discuss the school without marveling at its impact. And never are those words more powerful than when they come from the source.

            Meghan Price-Wlodarczyk graduated from the FAC dance program in 2001 and went on to earn her BFA and MFA in dance. She now lives in the Washington, DC, area and teaches dance at A. Mario Loiederman Middle School for the Creative and Performing Arts while working as the Technology Coordinator for the National Dance Education Organization. Meghan did a great job of summarizing how she, and so many others, feel about the FAC:
          </p>
          <p class="blockquote-fancy-small">
            "Many years ago a teacher saw potential in me as a dancer during a summer arts program and invited me into the ARMES program [at FAC].  During high school I continued my training at the FAC. I do what I do today because someone saw in me what I did not yet know myself. I could not imagine what else I would do in my life now and hope everyday that I will make the same difference in a young dancer's life. The FAC is a school like none other."
          </p>
          <p>
            A Taste of the Fine Arts is your opportunity to contribute to this remarkable school. We'll see you there.
