Repo for the Taste of the Fine Arts website, freshly migrated from geddy to express

A Taste of the Fine Arts, a sumptuous evening of fine food and entertainment designed to increase recognition and support of the Fine Arts Center of Greenville County Schools, will take place at 7:00 pm on Friday, February 1, 2013, at the Hyatt Regency in Downtown Greenville, SC. This year’s event will include delectable fare, world-class entertainment, artwork, silent and live auctions, and an open bar within the stylish, art-gallery atmosphere of the Hyatt’s Studio 220. It’s a venue and an event at which to see and be seen. Cocktail attire suggested.

The code is presently entirely static pages hosted by expressjs.

More dynamic features to come soon.
